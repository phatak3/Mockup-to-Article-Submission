You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

  * I have learned the basics os HTML syntax and formatting and useful links (like MDN reference library) where I can learn   
    more about HTML syntax.

  * HTML syntax upto now has been pretty easy. Looking forward to learning more!
  
  * Keeping an eye on details in HTML (since details are very important) has been challenging, but not difficult.
  
  * I take things I learn one step at a time, and try to not get overwhelmed. It has been pretty smooth sailing till now, so 
	thankfully I have not been anywhere near the desert of despair!
